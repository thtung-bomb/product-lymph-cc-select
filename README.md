## What I Built

### Pixel-Perfect UI Clone

- Recreated the landing page layout to closely match the reference:
  - Spacing
  - Typography
  - Colors
  - Visual hierarchy
  - UI sections are structured clearly and follow real eCommerce layout standards.

### Responsive Design

    - Fully responsive across:

- Desktop
- Tablet
- Mobile
  - Layout adapts smoothly using modern CSS practices.

### UI Interactions

    - Hover states for buttons and interactive elements
    - Sliders / carousels where applicable
    - Interactive UI components implemented with JavaScript when needed

### Clean & Maintainable Code

    - Well-structured HTML
    - Modular CSS (Tailwind CSS used where appropriate)
    - Readable class naming
    - No unnecessary logic or over-engineering

---

## AI Usage

AI tools (ChatGPT) were used to:

    - Speed up repetitive tasks
    - Generate mock data
    - Assist with refactoring and optimization

    However:

    - All generated code was reviewed and refined
    - I fully understand the implementation
    - Final structure and decisions are mine

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS / Tailwind CSS**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**

No external frameworks were used beyond what was necessary for UI behavior.
